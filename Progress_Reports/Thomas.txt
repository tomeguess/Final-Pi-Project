4/7 - 4/14 
Ordered Parts and Sensors 

4/14 - 4/21
Parts came in and I realized I need a few more 
Ordered the parts I needed
Then I messed around with the sensors and got the moisture sensor to work and tried to implement the humidity and temperature sensor

4/21 - 4/28
I tested all of the sensors and I got them all working
Got code for all of the sensors working and functional

4/28- 5/3
Got the misters and fans running and all of the circutry with them functional. 
Worked on getting all of the variables from the arduino to the python file. Ran into several issues with 
this and spent a long tweaking this. Figured out that you cannot update a GUI while importing variables from the Serial monitor 
so i had to make a funtion in a class to stagger the importing and updating of the GUI
